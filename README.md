# Machine Learning Model Evaluator

Project designed for users to build practical intuition around machine learning

The goal is to take out-of-the-box models and apply them to different datasets. This project revolves around 3 main objectives:

First, to build intuition for model-to-problem fit. Which models are robust to missing data? Which models handle categorical features well? Yes, you can dig through textbooks to find the answers, but you’ll learn better by seeing it in action.

Second, this project aims to teach you the invaluable skill of prototyping models quickly. In the real world, it’s often difficult to know which model will perform best without simply trying them.

Finally, this exercise helps you master the workflow of model building. For example, you’ll get to practice…
<ul>
<li> Importing data</li>
<li> Cleaning data</li>
<li> Splitting it into train/test or cross-validation sets</li>
<li> Pre-processing</li>
<li> Transformations</li>
<li> Feature engineering</li>
</ul>
Because we use out-of-the-box models, users have the chance to focus on honing these critical steps.
